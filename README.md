# William Barker, PhD

## About Me
I am a PhD Chemist and Microbiologist with a strong passion for leveraging data science and machine learning in the fields of chemistry and virology. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of these domains, and I am skilled in Python, SQL, R, and Bash scripting. I specialize in applying machine learning techniques to complex biological and chemical datasets.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R, SQL, Bash
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Database Management:** MySQL, PostgreSQL

## Experience
### Scientist, CSL Seqirus - 2021-Present
- Research Goals: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence implementations that capture the complex and stochastic nature of viral infections.

### Lead Scientist, Agile Sciences - 2020-2021
- Designed and performed biological assays that utilized small molecules to defeat antibiotic resistance. Defined novel strategies for treating problematic bacterial species in human and animal health: ESKAPE pathogens, Salmonella, Mycobacterium, Neisseria, Campylobacter, and many other fastidious bacterial species.


## Education
- PhD in Chemistry, Notre Dame, 2020

## Projects
- [PorscheChat](https://github.com/williamtbarker/porschechat) - An LLM chatbot pre-trained on data related to Porsche automobiles.
